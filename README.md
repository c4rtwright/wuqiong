# Wuqiong - Endless job search

'Wuqiong' is a mock front-end for a job search board. It's got the following pages:

- Landing page
- Search page (plus results) 
- Favorites (plus results)
- Profile page
- Settings page

The layout is Bulma-based, and Vue is used to generate search results, pop the login modal on the landing page, and a few other things. 

My goal with this was to create a fairly lean front-end for anyone creating a site or web app. It might not fit everyone's needs, but a lot of great things don't. And if you plan on starting a job search startup, this is a pretty good jump-off point.

All the files are plain HTML, CSS and JS, so it should be super easy to just take what you need and tweak.

Excuse the trashbag formatting, Notepad++ makes a shit IDE.
